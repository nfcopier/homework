This is all of the homework assignments for which
I have used source control. View the Readme in each
subfolder for more information on that class.

### CS 5300 Compiler Construction

The homework for this class was a single project

Pascal. The compiler outputs MIPS that can be executed
in MARS. The compiler was written in C++.

### CS 5410 Game Development
